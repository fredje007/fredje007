Yow, I'm an master student in Information Management at the KULeuven. My intention is to do the master in AI next year but my programming skills are not on point yet. That's why I created a Github profile. If you have any tips or cool websites to help me excel in (preferably) Java, let me know! 

Additionally, I'm also looking for some easy to contribute open-source coding. If you have a potential program, you may always send me a message. :)
